 ## Exploring some C's
 
 https://www.bluenile.com/education/diamonds
 
 The website explains the 4 C's of diamonds (Cut, Color, Clarity, Carat).  We will explore the relationships between the price of the diamond and the 4 C's.
 
 ## Carats, Cut, Clarity and Price
 
 This should be a fairly straightforward view.  We can see that across all cuts, the value of the diamond is heavily weighted by the clarity of the diamond.  You will notice that the diamond cutters obviously are spending more time getting an ideal cut on diamonds with the best clarity.
 
```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds)+
geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = clarity))+
  facet_wrap(~cut, nrow = 2)
```

## Clarity and Color

Again, we are seeing a similar pattern

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds)+
geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = clarity))+
  facet_wrap(~color, nrow = 2)
```
 
## Cut vs Clarity

This is admittedly an ugly chart and I would want to find a way to make it prettier.

I think I will revisit this later this weekend... I just need time to really think through how I want to approach this.
```{r}
Diamond_Carat <- diamonds %>% filter(carat<= 2)
ggplot(data = Diamond_Carat)+
  geom_jitter(mapping = aes(x = clarity, y=price, fill = carat))+
  facet_wrap(~cut)
