## Environment

Run this to set up the environment for plotting data

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Data Table

Put there here to help visualize the data as a Table

```{r}
ggplot2::diamonds
```
>



## Initial Histogram

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds,mapping = aes(price)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 500)
```

## Mind the Gap

Notice there appears to be a gap in the data that does not make sense.  This chart narrows the resolution.

```{r}

Diamond_Gap <- diamonds %>% filter(price <= 1600 & price >= 1400)
ggplot(Diamond_Gap,mapping = aes(price)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50)+
  ggtitle("Data Might Be Missing")

```


## Exploring the Gap in Data

Let's create a tibble that narrows in on the prices between $1453 and $1546 just to confirm.  And yes, there is a gap where the prices skip from $1454 to $1546.  This is noted because there clearly is an issue with the data.  It doesn't make sense that there is a $90+ gap

```{r}

ggplot2::diamonds %>% filter(price <= 1546 & price >= 1453)
```

## This is just the initial data analysis.
